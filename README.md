## About This Project
This project was made as an assignment for Avans Hogeschool Breda. This api can support an application by providing various functionalities such as: adding, modifying and deleting meals and users. Those users also have the option to participate in meals. 

This API is built-in with authentication that allows only the owner of a meal to edit and delete the meal. This authentication also applies to managing user accounts. This authentication is realized through the use of tokens. These tokens are provided to a user when they log in and can be used to access various functionalities. 

These jsonwebtokens are generated by using [jwt](https://jwt.io).
